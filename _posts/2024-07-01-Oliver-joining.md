We would like to welcome Dr. Oliver Kohl as a new postdoc to our lab! 
Oliver completed his PhD at the University of Oxford under the supervision of Kia Nobre and Mark Woolrich on resting state networks (RSN) alterations in Parkinson´s disease and their connection to cortical decline and dysfunction. 
Funded by the Volkswagen Foundation, Oliver will continue to work on Parkinson’s disease, focusing on RSN analysis using Hidden Markov models, to identify RSN changes due to Parkinson´s disease and the modulation of such RSN by medication and deep brain stimulation. 
We are looking forward to Oliver's exciting research!
