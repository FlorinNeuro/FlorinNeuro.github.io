<!-- excerpt start -->
Hurrah! Oliver Kohl and colleagues have published part of his PhD research in Brain Communications.
<!-- excerpt end -->
They report that sensorimotor network dynamics, extracted from magnetoencephalography recordings, are altered in individuals with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) compared to controls. Furthermore, they highlight the importance of considering the large-scale network context of motor cortical activations for understanding pathophysiological changes in PD.
