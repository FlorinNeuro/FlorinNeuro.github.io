We are happy to announce that the second funding period for the Collaborative Research Center CRC 295 "ReTune" has been officially approved! ([Check out the ReTune website for more details.](https://sfb-retune.de/de/home-de/))

The primary aim of this project is to develop and refine neuromodulation therapies for movement disorders, such as dystonia and Parkinson's disease. By investigating the neurophysiological effects of these treatments, we hope to improve both our understanding of these conditions and the effectiveness of their treatments.

Our research group is contributing to two key projects within the center:


- Project B04: Identifying Functional Network Properties to Guide Neuromodulation in Pediatric and Adult Hyperkinetic Movement Disorders. This project focuses on understanding how different brain networks function in hyperkinetic movement disorders, with the goal of using this knowledge to optimize neuromodulation techniques.

- Project C01: Characterization and Modulation of Oscillatory Bursting Activity in the Basal Ganglia-Thalamo-Cortical Network in Parkinson's Disease. This project aims to explore the role of oscillatory brain activity in Parkinson's disease and develop strategies for modulating these patterns to improve patient outcomes.


We are excited to continue our work in this cutting-edge area of research and look forward to the insights that will emerge from this new phase of the project.
