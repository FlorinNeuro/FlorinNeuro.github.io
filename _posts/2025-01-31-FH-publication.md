<!-- excerpt start -->
Congrats! Fabrice Hubschmid and colleagues just published his first paper during his PhD on pain modulation in the Journal PAIN. ["PAIN"](https://journals.lww.com/pain/fulltext/9900/mechanisms_of_increased_pain_discrimination_by.801.aspx)
<!-- excerpt end -->
They investigated how pain discrimination can be enhanced for adaptive purposes in healthy human decision-makers with a combination of drift-diffusion and reinforcement learning models. To find out more, check out the paper!
