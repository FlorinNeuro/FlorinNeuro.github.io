<!-- excerpt start -->
A manuscript by Thomas and colleagues investigating auditory processing in Parkinson's disease was just published by the *International Journal of Neural Systems*.
<!-- excerpt end -->
They report a pathological effect of Parkinson's disease on auditory steady state responses at varying frequencies. Their results further indicate that subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) contributes to counteracting this pathological effect.

Read more about it from the full [paper](https://doi.org/10.1142/S0129065725500820).
