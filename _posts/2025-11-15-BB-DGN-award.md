<!-- excerpt start -->
Bahne was awarded a first poster prize at the 98th congress of the German Neurological Society (DGN).
<!-- excerpt end -->
His poster "Mapping the cortical effects of pallidal DBS in dystonia" was selected for the poster prize in the session on movement disorders. He presented results from a joint MEG project with Charité Berlin characterizing the cortical low-frequency power changes induced by deep brain stimulation in patients with cervical dystonia. Previously, low-frequency oscillations had been defined as a basal ganglia signature of hyperkinetic movement disorders. However, so far, the therapeutic relevance of cortical low-frequency oscillations in the context of deep brain stimulation was poorly understood. Bahne and colleagues showed that low-frequency power changes in the supplementary motor area correlated with DBS outcomes in this patient cohort. These results could guide DBS programming and targeting in the future.
