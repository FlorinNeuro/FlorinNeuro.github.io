<!-- excerpt start -->
Bahne won the Early Career Scientist Award of the Movement Disorder Society (MDS)! 
<!-- excerpt end -->

The award honors scientist under 40 years of age, who submitted top-ranked abstracts to the congress. 
In his work, he investigated the functional connectivity of the whole cortex and the subthalamic nucleus in Parkinson´s Patients with deep brain stimulation. 
They assessed MEG and Local-field potential data simultaneously, which made it possible to assess functional connectivity without temporal delay.
