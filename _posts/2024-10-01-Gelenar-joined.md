<!-- excerpt start -->
We would like to welcome Julia Gelenar Marae as a new postdoc to our lab! 
<!-- excerpt end -->

Gelenar is a medical doctor with a focus on neurological disorders, especially movement disorders. She worked on auditory cortex engagement during silent reading during her doctoral thesis, which was supervised by Katja Biermann-Ruben. 
As a part of the CRC 295 ReTune project, Gelenar will work on the characterization and modulation of oscillatory bursting activity within the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical network in Parkinson’s disease.

We are looking forward to Gelenar´s exciting research!
