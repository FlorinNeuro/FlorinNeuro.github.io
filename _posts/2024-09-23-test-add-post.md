<!-- excerpt end -->

Jan recently completed his graduate studies in translational neuroscience, with a focus on reward processing in chronic pain, at Heinrich Heine University in Düsseldorf.
As part of the CRC 295 ReTune project, Jan will be working on the characterization and modulation of oscillatory bursting activity within the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical network in Parkinson’s disease. 

We are looking forward to Jan´s exciting research!
