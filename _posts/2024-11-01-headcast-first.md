<!-- excerpt start -->
We completed the first Head cast production in our lab! We aim to improve the Source Reconstruction Signal-to-Noise ratio substantially by providing participants with more support during measurements and restricting their head movements to a minimum.

As part of the CRC 295 ReTune project, we are excited to share that we’ve made significant progress in implementing high-precision magnetoencephalography (hpMEG) measurements. Today, we successfully created our first individual head cast and completed an initial measurement.
While there is still room for improvement, we are pleased with the progress we’ve made in such a short time frame. This is an important step forward in our research, especially in advancing project C01, and we look forward to refining this technique as we continue our work to better understand movement disorders and the effects of neuromodulation therapies.
