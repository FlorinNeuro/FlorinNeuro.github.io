Oliver completed his PhD at the University of Oxford under the supervision of Kia Nobre and Mark Woolrich on resting state networks (RSN) alterations in Parkinson´s disease and their connection to cortical decline and dysfunction. 
Funded by the Volkswagen Foundation, Oliver will continue to work on Parkinson’s disease, focusing on RSN analysis using Hidden Markov models, to identify RSN changes due to Parkinson´s disease and the modulation of such RSN by medication and deep brain stimulation. 
We are looking forward to Oliver’s exciting research!</p>]]></content><author><name>Jan Schalla</name></author><category term="People" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We would like to welcome Dr. Oliver Kohl as a new postdoc to our lab!

(<a href="https://sfb-retune.de/de/home-de/">Check out the ReTune website for more details.</a>)</p>

<p>The primary aim of this project is to develop and refine neuromodulation therapies for movement disorders, such as dystonia and Parkinson’s disease. By investigating the neurophysiological effects of these treatments, we hope to improve both our understanding of these conditions and the effectiveness of their treatments.</p>

<p>Our research group is contributing to two key projects within the center:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Project B04: Identifying Functional Network Properties to Guide Neuromodulation in Pediatric and Adult Hyperkinetic Movement Disorders. This project focuses on understanding how different brain networks function in hyperkinetic movement disorders, with the goal of using this knowledge to optimize neuromodulation techniques.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Project C01: Characterization and Modulation of Oscillatory Bursting Activity in the Basal Ganglia-Thalamo-Cortical Network in Parkinson’s Disease. This project aims to explore the role of oscillatory brain activity in Parkinson’s disease and develop strategies for modulating these patterns to improve patient outcomes.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We are excited to continue our work in this cutting-edge area of research and look forward to the insights that will emerge from this new phase of the project.</p>]]></content><author><name>Jan Schalla</name></author><category term="grant" /><category term="PD" /><category term="MEG" /><category term="LFP" /><category term="Dystonia" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are happy to announce that the second funding period for the Collaborative Research Center CRC 295 “ReTune” has been officially approved!
