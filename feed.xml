<p>As part of the CRC 295 ReTune project, we are excited to share that we’ve made significant progress in implementing high-precision magnetoencephalography (hpMEG) measurements. Today, we successfully created our first individual head cast and completed an initial measurement.
While there is still room for improvement, we are pleased with the progress we’ve made in such a short time frame. This is an important step forward in our research, especially in advancing project C01, and we look forward to refining this technique as we continue our work to better understand movement disorders and the effects of neuromodulation therapies.</p>]]></content><author><name>Jan Schalla</name></author><category term="hpMEG" /><category term="Head cast" /><category term="CRC 295" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We completed the first Head cast production in our lab!

<p>Bahne won the Early Career Scientist Award of the Movement Disorder Society (MDS)! 
<!-- excerpt end --></p>

<p>The award honors scientist under 40 years of age, who submitted top-ranked abstracts to the congress. 
In his work, he investigated the functional connectivity of the whole cortex and the subthalamic nucleus in Parkinson´s Patients with deep brain stimulation. 
They assessed MEG and Local-field potential data simultaneously, which made it possible to assess functional connectivity without temporal delay.</p>
