<p>As part of the CRC 295 ReTune project, we are excited to share that we’ve made significant progress in implementing high-precision magnetoencephalography (hpMEG) measurements. Today, we successfully created our first individual head cast and completed an initial measurement.
While there is still room for improvement, we are pleased with the progress we’ve made in such a short time frame. This is an important step forward in our research, especially in advancing project C01, and we look forward to refining this technique as we continue our work to better understand movement disorders and the effects of neuromodulation therapies.</p>]]></content><author><name>Jan Schalla</name></author><category term="hpMEG" /><category term="Head cast" /><category term="CRC 295" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We completed the first Head cast production in our lab!

<p>Bahne won the Early Career Scientist Award of the Movement Disorder Society (MDS)! 
<!-- excerpt end --></p>

<p>The award honors scientist under 40 years of age, who submitted top-ranked abstracts to the congress. 
In his work, he investigated the functional connectivity of the whole cortex and the subthalamic nucleus in Parkinson´s Patients with deep brain stimulation. 
They assessed MEG and Local-field potential data simultaneously, which made it possible to assess functional connectivity without temporal delay.</p>

<p>We are happy to announce that the second funding period for the Collaborative Research Center CRC 295 <a href="https://sfb-retune.de/en/home/">“ReTune”</a> has been officially approved!
<!-- excerpt end --></p>

<p>The primary aim of this project is to develop and refine neuromodulation therapies for movement disorders, such as dystonia and Parkinson’s disease. By investigating the neurophysiological effects of these treatments, we hope to improve both our understanding of these conditions and the effectiveness of their treatments.</p>

<p>Our research group is contributing to two key projects within the center:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Project B04: Identifying Functional Network Properties to Guide Neuromodulation in Pediatric and Adult Hyperkinetic Movement Disorders. This project focuses on understanding how different brain networks function in hyperkinetic movement disorders, with the goal of using this knowledge to optimize neuromodulation techniques.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Project C01: Characterization and Modulation of Oscillatory Bursting Activity in the Basal Ganglia-Thalamo-Cortical Network in Parkinson’s Disease. This project aims to explore the role of oscillatory brain activity in Parkinson’s disease and develop strategies for modulating these patterns to improve patient outcomes.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We are excited to continue our work in this cutting-edge area of research and look forward to the insights that will emerge from this new phase of the project.</p>]]></content><author><name>Jan Schalla</name></author><category term="grant" /><category term="PD" /><category term="MEG" /><category term="LFP" /><category term="Dystonia" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are happy to announce that the second funding period for the Collaborative Research Center CRC 295 “ReTune” has been officially approved!]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://florinneuro.github.io/images/news/logo-retune.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://florinneuro.github.io/images/news/logo-retune.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
