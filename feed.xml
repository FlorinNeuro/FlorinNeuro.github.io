<p>A manuscript by Thomas and colleagues investigating auditory processing in Parkinson’s disease was just published by the <em>International Journal of Neural Systems</em>.
<!-- excerpt end -->
They report a pathological effect of Parkinson’s disease on auditory steady state responses at varying frequencies. Their results further indicate that subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) contributes to counteracting this pathological effect.</p>

They report that sensorimotor network dynamics, extracted from magnetoencephalography recordings, are altered in individuals with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) compared to controls. Furthermore, they highlight the importance of considering the large-scale network context of motor cortical activations for understanding pathophysiological changes in PD.</p>
