  description: While deep brain stimulation (**DBS**) has been used clinically for many years, its efficacy is not systematic, wanes with time, and sometimes causes side effects.

  description: While the primary focus in Parkinson’s disease research is commonly on motor symptoms and their treatment, both DBS and dopaminergic medication are associated with non-motor side effects.
