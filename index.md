# Welcome to the Florin Lab !

We are a part of the Institute of Clinical Neuroscience and Medical Psychology at the University Hospital in DÃ¼sseldorf.

Many neurological diseases lead to pathological changes in brain signals that are already visible during rest. This makes analyzing spontaneous activity a promising avenue to better understand the brain's function and dysfunction. Our research aims at providing a characterization of the neurophysiological basis of the brain's resting state networks (RSNs) by determining how communication between and within RSNs is mediated. This goal is achieved by analyzing electro-/magnetoencephaolographic (E/MEG) data from healthy participants and Parkinson (PD) patients.

Results obtained are translationally used to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease.  A particular focus is on tracing out the electrophysiological mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of dopaminergic treatment and deep brain stimulation for Parkinson patients.
