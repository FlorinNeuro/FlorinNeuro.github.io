While these networks have been analyzed in a static manner, it is obvious that the brain navigates through these networks in a dynamic fashion. Therefore, we also investigate dynamic changes of spontaneous networks and how those relate to task-related activity using Hidden Markov Models (Hirschmann et al., 2020). With this analysis, we could identify a brain network, which was predictive of a strong visual gamma response. In a second study, we investigated tactile perception and could identify network switches before the percept, which were predictive of the reported percept (Sharma et al. 2023).
