While the primary focus in Parkinson’s disease research is commonly on motor symptoms and their treatment, both DBS and dopaminergic medication are associated with side effects. Using a behavioral study, we showed that even if DBS alleviates the motor symptoms, it can cause increased risk-taking behavior in these patients, potentially seriously affecting their social interaction and behavior in workplace environments (Florin et al., 2013; Zapf et al., 2022). At the neuronal level, we employed machine learning to identify an additional frontal network associated with dopamine treatment in PD patients that could be related to cognitive side effects (Sharma et al., 2021).
