Concerning dopaminergic treatment, we behaviorally evaluated the two pain systems in Parkinsonâ€™s disease and provided evidence of impaired emotional-motivational pain processing in PD (Florin et al., 2020). These studies underscore the need to understand better the side effects of current DBS and medical treatment and further improve these options.
