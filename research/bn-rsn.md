Functional imaging of the resting brain consistently reveals broad motifs of correlated activity that engage cerebral regions from distinct functional systems. Yet, the neurophysiological processes underlying these organized large-scale fluctuations have been unknown. Our MEG research indicates that a gating mechanism in the synchronized dynamics of neural oscillations accounts for these fluctuations (Florin and Baillet, 2015) and envelope correlations (Pelzer et al., 2024).
