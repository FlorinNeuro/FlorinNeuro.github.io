Currently we are working within the [CRC 295 Retune](https://sfb-retune.de/de/home-de/) on advancing the understanding of both oscillatory and non-oscillatory bursting activity in PD pathophysiology. In addition, we are identifying the predictive capacity of DBS-evoked and induced cortical responses in generalized dystonia, thus translating our findings from Parkinsonâ€™s disease to Dystonia. Ultimately, these insights should enhance the development of neurophysiologically-informed closed-loop stimulation approaches.
