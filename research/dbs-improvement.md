When stimulating in the STN, the cortical evoked and induced responses within motor areas are predictive of motor outcomes and the optimal stimulation location (Spooner et al., 2023 & 2024; Bahners et al., 2023). The mechanisms of these cortical evoked responses likely relate to the antidromic activation of the hyperdirect pathway. Moreover,  these findings have great clinical relevance as they might help to improve DBS treatment in PD patients.
