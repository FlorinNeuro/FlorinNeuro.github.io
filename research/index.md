Our research aim is to understand cognition and behavior in healthy subjects and neurological patients. Therefore we identify mechanisms of communication and network dynamics within the human brain.  For this aim our lab uses M/EEG to non-invasively investigate brain function. We combine these recordings in patients with invasive LFP recordings.
