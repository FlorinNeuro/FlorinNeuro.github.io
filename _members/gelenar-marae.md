I am a Resident Physician in Neurology and a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Institute for Clinical Neuroscience and Medical Psychology, University Hospital Düsseldorf. Under the supervision of Prof. Esther Florin and as part of the Collaborative Research Center 295 (SFB 295) - Retune, my research investigates the neural connectivity and oscillatory dynamics in Parkinson's disease patients and healthy individuals. I focus on understanding the impacts of deep brain stimulation (DBS) and medication by employing advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetoencephalography (MEG). My objective is to enhance therapeutic approaches and improve clinical outcomes for neurodegenerative disorders by translating fundamental neuroscience findings into clinical practice.

**Education**
- Doctor of Medicine, Heinrich Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany
