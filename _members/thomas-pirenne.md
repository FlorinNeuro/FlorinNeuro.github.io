<!-- Intro -->
I am a PhD student of the Institute for Clinical Neuroscience and Medical Psychology at the Universitätsklinikum Düsseldorf (Germany), supervised by Prof. Esther Florin, and funded by the Volkswagen Foundation.

<!-- Background (studies, work experience if relevant) -->
I have a B.Sc. in Engineering, and an M.Sc in Computer Science Engineering (focus on Intelligent Systems), both from the University of Liège (Belgium). I have spent the following year doing research as a predoctoral student in the Laboratory for Neuro- and Psychophysiology at KULeuven (Belgium) with Prof. Marc Van Hulle.

<!-- Project (Project(s) worked and working on in the lab) -->
In the context of my PhD, I currently investigate multivariate causality estimation methods and their limitations when applied to whole-brain electrophysiology. Overcoming these limitations motivates the development of a method leveraging anatomical information derived from Diffusion Tensor Imaging of the brain. This method makes possible further investigation of brain dynamics in both healthy and neurodegenerative patients. Specifically, I aim at improving our understanding of brain dynamics during rest, and how they are affected by Parkinson's disease.

<!-- Interests (topics, research, technology) -->
I am personally interested in many topics, among which are Neurophysiology, Neuronal Electrophysiology, Causality estimation, Brain connectivity, Brain imaging, Brain interfacing, Evolution Strategies, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Unsupervised ML, and data-driven methods of analysis in general.
