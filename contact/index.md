All open positions are advertised here. Further, the Florin-Lab also invites spontaneous applications for a wide variety of positions such as: Research Assistants, PhD students and Post-Doctoral Researchers. Any spontaneous application should include a letter of motivation/intent, a Curriculum Vitae, and if applicable a publication list. All applications should be sent via [email](esther.florin@hhu.de). Given the interdisciplinary nature of the lab, we seek motivated applicants from a wide variety of fields such as: Neuroscience, Cognitive Science, Psychology, Physics, Computer Science and Biology. While spontaneous applications do not come with specific job requirements we encourage applicants to have some background in programming mainly with MatLab. Additionally, strong knowledge of English is required given it is our official lab language.
